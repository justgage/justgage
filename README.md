### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

These are things that I think every Programmer should check out:

# Talks

- [Simple Made Easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy): If you do nothing else on this page **watch this talk!!!**. It will change the way you think about programming forever.
- [Value of Values](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Value-Values) This is the second one you should look at! It will also change the way you think about programming forever. 
- [JavaScript: the good parts](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQVTIJBZook): There's a very good chance that you're going to be writing some JavaScript sometime in your life. 'bout time you learned what it really is. 

# Programming Styles

- [Functional Programming](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/07/dont-be-scared-of-functional-programming/): It will change the way you think about code forever. NOTE: This blog post isn't perfect but I haven't found anything better yet.

# Frameworks

- [Phonix Framework](phoenixframework.org): A Rails like web framework that is _far faster_. Written in Elixir.
- [Love2d](love2d.org): A game Frameworks that is the first one I've found that _isn't_ Object Oriented.

# Languages

- [Elixir](elixir-lang.org): The most friendly functional language for the backend
- [ReasonML](https://reasonml.github.io/): Awsome compile to JS/native language built on OCaml's compiler.
- [Elm Lang](elm-lang.org): No runtime exceptions? Enforcing [semantic](semver.org) versioning? Friendly Complier Messages? Yes Please!
- [Prolog](swi-prolog.org): This one will _bend your mind!_. 
- [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/): It's everywhere, and it can be really good so long as you _do not_ use inheritance or any sort in it.
    - [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react/) This is the best framework for JavaScript hands down. Far simpler than Angular and far easier to test then just about anything.
- [Go](golang.com): Perhaps one of the best Languages focused on _less_ features. Great concurrency. And `go fmt` is genius.

# Books

- [Deep Work](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/).This book is essential for any programmer. It basically talks how costly being distracted can effect your performance at tasks that require deep concentration (programming anyone?). It helps me realize that checking your email every two minutes or browsing twitter and other activates are really hurting your productivity. 

- [7 Languages in 7 Weeks](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks). A great way to get introduced to lots of different programming styles

# White Papers
- [Out of the Tar Pit](http://www.shaffner.us/cs/papers/tarpit.pdf). This is a very interesting look at the sources of complexity in code. It helps see some of the reasons why Functional and Logic programming, yet doesn't toot their horn too much. 

# OS

- Linux: If you haven't had Linux on your computer once, you need to
    - AwesomeWM: This is a cool tiling window manager. Read up on the key bindings before you try

# Blog Posts

- [Is group chat making you sweat?](https://m.signalvnoise.com/is-group-chat-making-you-sweat/). After you read this you will never look at Slack the same again.
- [The Last Responsible Moment](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-last-responsible-moment/)

# Videos

- [Composition over Inheritance](https://medium.com/humans-create-software/composition-over-inheritance-cb6f88070205) Everyone should know the dangers of using Inheritance.
